# Make-PDF-With-PHP-Form-

It's a simple form made with php and ajax which generates a pdf document of the fields you enter using fpdf package for php. 
you do that by entering a field title in an input then you add a content in a textarea and you can add as many fields as you want. 
you can also add your signature if you want by drawing it with your mouse or touch screen or you can just skip the signature part by unchecking the checkbox above it :).

fpdf package: http://www.fpdf.org/

The front end is built over a form template you can find in this address: https://codepen.io/colorlib/pen/rxddKy

The front end signature pad is copied from this codepen page: https://codepen.io/kunukn/pen/kkbNvx
